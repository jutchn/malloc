Workload D:
This workload tests the maximum capacity of the memory by allocating blocks of 4 bytes (2 byte data 2 byte metadata) into the memory array until it is a maximum capacity (4096 bytes 1024 blocks). The workload then frees every other block so that there are 512 blocks remaining in memory separated by gaps of 4 bytes between them. Then it mallocs into those gaps 512 times to refill up memory to max capacity and subsequently frees all 1024 blocks to reset the memory. The workload verifies the memory usage of malloc to be 2 bytes + x bytes of the users choosing and the ability of malloc to allocate into gaps between allocated memory.
